Monte Carlo Simulation for TSLA Stock Price Forecasting

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates the application of Monte Carlo Simulation to forecast Tesla (TSLA) stock price movements. The script performs stochastic modeling using Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM), visualizes potential future price paths, and calculates statistical metrics.

Description

The script performs the following operations:

Data Collection: Loads historical TSLA stock price data and related market proxy information.

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares data for simulation.

Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) Model:

Estimates drift and volatility from historical returns.

Simulates multiple future price paths using GBM.

Monte Carlo Simulation:

Runs a large number of simulations to generate a probabilistic forecast.

Uses random sampling to model uncertainty in stock price movements.

Visualization:

Plots the simulated price paths.

Generates histograms of predicted price distributions.

Statistical Analysis:

Computes expected future price ranges.

Analyzes confidence intervals and risk metrics.

File Structure

data/: Contains historical stock price data.

notebooks/: Jupyter Notebooks with analysis and visualization.

src/: Source code for Monte Carlo simulations.

results/: Outputs from simulations, including price distributions.

README.md: Project documentation.

Usage

Ensure the following libraries are installed before running the script:

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

scipy

yfinance

To run the script, navigate to the script's directory and execute it in a Python environment:

python monte_carlo_simulation.py

Visualizations

The script generates key visualizations, including:

Simulated Price Paths: Displays multiple future price scenarios for TSLA.

Probability Distributions: Shows the likelihood of different price outcomes.

Configuration

Modify the script to adjust parameters such as the number of simulations, time horizon, and drift assumptions:

num_simulations = 1000  # Number of Monte Carlo iterations
time_horizon = 252  # Forecasting horizon in trading days
